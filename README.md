What if the End had a new ore that was even stronger than Ancient Debris?

Introducing **Abyssium**, a new Fabric 1.21.5 mod that adds a new ore called "Abyssium"!

Keep in mind the **already generated** chunks will not contain **Abyssium**. This is due to that the mod does **not** edit already generated chunks to include **Abyssium**. It is recommended you start a new world for the **complete experience** of **Abyssium**.

### Crafting Recipes
You can **craft** Abyssium tools the same way you can craft **diamond tools**. **No** smithing table is required.
